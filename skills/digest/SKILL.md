# Digest

Generates daily reports and research reports. Both source directly from jsonl — daily by per-line timestamp slicing, research by topic keyword scanning (main Claude reads jsonl itself, no sub-agent delegation). MEMORY.md provides background context.

Read `$PLUME_ROOT/config.yml` for `locale` (timezone, language), `digest` (default_scope).

> A report MUST cover ALL active sessions within scope. Always read source files — never summarize from memory alone.

> **Ask-Before-Persist interaction**: digest's output paths are pre-configured via `config.yml` and fixed by convention (`data/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `data/reports/<slug>.md`). Treat this as the user having pre-confirmed the write destination at install time — no per-invocation path confirmation needed. The `/digest` command is itself the explicit trigger; cron / `-p` mode cannot confirm interactively anyway. The Report Update prompt (merge / overwrite / save-as-new / cancel) serves as the per-invocation gate for overwrites.

## /digest daily [YYYY-MM-DD] [--scope keyword]

Generate a daily report. Default date: today.

### Scope

Resolution: `--scope` arg > `config.yml default_scope` > ask user.
Matching: Claude project slug **contains** scope keyword as substring.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Enumerate main session jsonls (top-level only)**

Find scoped project dirs in `~/.claude/projects/`. For each project, enumerate **only top-level `*.jsonl`** as main session files. Do NOT recurse — `subagents/agent-*.jsonl` are sub-agent traces and must be excluded.

> ⚠️ Do NOT use the Glob tool for this step. Glob recurses into subdirectories and has a result cap; in projects with many subagent files, truncation will silently drop the most recent main sessions. Always enumerate via Bash/Python with non-recursive listing:

```bash
# Preferred: one-shot enumeration with start timestamp + mtime, sorted by mtime desc
for f in ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl; do
  start=$(head -1 "$f" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.loads(sys.stdin.read()).get('timestamp',''))")
  mtime=$(stat --format=%Y "$f")
  echo "$mtime $start $(basename $f)"
done | sort -rn
```

For each main session jsonl, determine if the session was **active on the target date** using interval overlap:

1. **session_start**: first line `timestamp` field (ISO 8601 UTC)
2. **session_end**: file mtime (`stat --format=%Y` or `os.path.getmtime()`)
3. **target window**: read `digest.cron_time` from config (default `06:00`). Window = target date `cron_time` ~ next day `cron_time` (in config timezone, converted to UTC)
4. **Match condition**: `session_start < target_end AND session_end >= target_start`

This correctly captures cross-day sessions. Do NOT rely on mtime alone — it misses sessions that started on the target date but are still active later.

**Sanity check**: After enumeration, verify the count matches a direct directory listing (`ls ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl | wc -l`). If a session you'd expect (e.g. the current one) is missing, re-enumerate — never trust a partial list.

Display matched projects + session counts to user for confirmation (skip if cron/`-p` mode).

**Step 2 — Slice each session by timestamp window**

**jsonl is the authoritative source. Always read it.** Main Claude slices directly — do not delegate. Each line in a jsonl carries its own `timestamp` field. The jsonl is append-only and contains the complete session history from first message to last — a cross-day session naturally appears in multiple daily reports with disjoint slices. **Tail-based reading is wrong for cross-day sessions.** Per-line timestamp filtering is the only correct mechanism.

For each active session:

1. **Filter the jsonl** to lines whose `timestamp` falls within the target window `[target_start, target_end)`. This slice belongs to the target date's report.
2. Summarize from the slice. Focus on user requests, decisions, files modified, outcomes.
3. **Cross-check files actually modified**: if the slice mentions writing files, verify with `stat` that mtimes fall within the window. Catches anything the slice paraphrasing missed.

Use `python3 -c "..."` for filtering (already whitelisted). Avoid heredoc (`<<'PY'`) and `#` comments inside `-c` — both trigger sandbox patterns. Scratch files, if needed, go under `$PLUME_ROOT/data/.tmp/digest-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` (whitelisted for Write / mkdir / rm); clean up at Step 3 end.

```bash
# Inline filter (one-liner, no comments in the -c string)
python3 -c "import sys,json; path,s,e=sys.argv[1:]; \
[print(l,end='') for l in open(path) \
 if s<=(json.loads(l).get('timestamp','') or '')<e]" "$jsonl" "$start_utc" "$end_utc"
```

Read MEMORY.md for project context (background only).

> Why jsonl with per-line timestamp filtering: jsonl is the system-written ground truth. Tail is a hack that breaks for long sessions. Per-line timestamp slicing is the only mechanism that correctly handles both short single-day sessions and ultra-long multi-day sessions.

**Step 3** — Generate using `$PLUME_ROOT/templates/daily-report.md`. Write to `$PLUME_ROOT/data/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. If file exists → **Report Update**.

If a scratch directory was created in Step 2, `rm -rf $PLUME_ROOT/data/.tmp/digest-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` before exiting.

> **Exclude self-referential digest work**: If a session's slice content is almost entirely a `/digest` command invocation and its execution trace, treat it as noise and omit it from the report — no entry, no count, no mention. The daily report describes user work, not the act of generating itself (e.g. do not emit "自动生成日报" / "Cron 触发 digest" style entries).

## /digest report [natural language topic]

Generate a research report on a topic across scoped sessions.

> **Note**: after v3 slim-design removed context-keeper, this command no longer has snapshots/CONTEXT-INDEX to lean on — main Claude scans jsonl directly. Research reports are expected to be used infrequently.

### Steps

**Step 1** — Enumerate scoped jsonls (same as daily Step 1, no window filter — cover all jsonls in scope regardless of date).

**Step 2** — For each jsonl, grep for topic keywords to locate relevant exchanges, then read those line ranges. Read MEMORY.md for background.

If the user gave no argument, surface a short list of topic clusters derived from recent sessions and let the user pick.

**Step 3** — Generate using `$PLUME_ROOT/templates/research-report.md`. Write to `$PLUME_ROOT/data/reports/<topic-slug>.md`. If file exists → **Report Update**.

## /digest status

Display: configured scope, matched projects, per-project jsonl count, today's active sessions, daily report existence.

---

## Report Update

When target file exists, present 4 options: Merge / Overwrite / Save as new (`-v2.md`) / Cancel.

Daily merge: 工作详情 append/update → 今日成果 regenerate → 明日计划 use newer.
Research merge: 核心发现 merge → 关键认知 keep all → 结论与建议 regenerate → 参考 union.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| No active sessions for date | Report "No activity found." |
| In-window slice exceeds ~1500 lines | Grep the slice for tool calls / file writes / decisions and summarize selectively; don't read the whole slice verbatim |
| Cross-day session: which day owns it? | Both. Each day's report shows that day's timestamp slice; slices are disjoint and complementary |
| Session listing seems suspiciously short | Re-enumerate with non-recursive `ls` + `wc -l` cross-check |
| `python3 -c` string gets rejected (sandbox pattern) | Rephrase to avoid `#` comments and heredoc; if still blocked, ask user — do NOT write a helper `.py` to the workspace |
| Write fails | Output report to chat |
